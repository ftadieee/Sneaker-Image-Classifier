# Sneaker-Image-Classifier
This is a small project tried and experimented on Google Colab. It has different images for 3 brands which are Nike, Adidas &amp; Puma. 
(Note : The file gets updated every Sunday as more images are being added to the training dataset for much accurate predictions
Thank you :)


This is a complete Vibe Coding Project so feel free to suggest any suggestion for improv or any advice :)

Day 4: The Brain and the Vision 🧠 (Jan 6, 2026)
Today was all about Vibe Coding—moving fast from a blank screen to a functional Deep Learning model. We focused on the architecture and intent, letting the AI orchestrate the complex code while we curated the data and directed the flow.

🚀 What We Accomplished Today:
Infrastructure Setup: Initialized the project kitchen in Google Colab with TensorFlow and MobileNetV2.
Data Scraped & Deep Cleaned: Built a custom scraper to pull 200+ images per silhouette. Performed a manual and automated "Data Purge" to ensure no "socks" or junk data corrupted the model's IQ.
Brain Surgery (Transfer Learning): Leveraged the pre-trained weights of Google's MobileNetV2 to specialize in sneaker silhouettes.
The Big Train: Successfully trained the model to distinguish between the Nike Air Force 1 and Nike Court Vision with a final validation accuracy of 86%.
Model Checkpointing: Saved the first iteration of our intelligence as sneaker_classifier_v1.h5.

👟 The Silhouette Challenge:
The model is now learning to spot the minute differences between look-alike shoes:
Midsole thickness (AF1 vs. Court Vision).
Perforation patterns on the toe box.
Outsole height and stitching detail.
